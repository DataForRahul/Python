Survival Duration Calculator
Thought Process   :   The idea for this project stemmed from a common curiosity many of us have: just how much time have we actually spent on this Earth? 
It's fascinating to break down our age into different time units and see the vast numbers that accumulate over years of living. 
This project aims to provide an easy way to satisfy this curiosity with precise calculations.
Design and Development :
User-Friendliness: The first priority was to create a tool that anyone could use without hassle.
The script prompts users for their age and desired time unit in a straightforward manner.

Flexibility in Input: To accommodate different user preferences, the script accepts both full names and abbreviations for time units. 
For example, users can input 'Months' or just 'M', and the script will understand both.

Accuracy: Considering leap years, the script uses accurate conversion factors:

1 year = 12 months
1 year ≈ 52.1775 weeks
1 year ≈ 365.25 days
1 day = 24 hours
1 hour = 60 minutes
1 minute = 60 seconds
Error Handling: The script is designed to handle invalid inputs gracefully, providing clear error messages to guide the user.
Natural Language Processing: To make the input process smoother, the script standardizes the time unit input, converting various forms to a consistent internal representation.
